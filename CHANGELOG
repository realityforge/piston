1.4.1 (Pending)

1.4.0 (2008-02-07)
* New piston diff subcommand, implemented by Graeme Mathieson.
  http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=17116&group_id=2105&atid=8179
* Per http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?func=detail&atid=8179&aid=10717&group_id=2105
  Don't set LC_ALL, but set LANGUAGE so that repositories with foreign
  characters can be used.  Thanks go to Per Wigren.

1.3.3 (2007-03-22)
* Repaired problems with import subcommand.  Wrote specifications to prevent
  the same failure mode again.

1.3.2 (2007-03-09)
* piston switch had a bad constant access which caused failures.

1.3.1 (2007-03-09)
* piston switch would fail if the branch from which we are reading had been
  deleted.
* piston switch had a major bug.  It did not update the piston:root property
  to remember the new repository root.  Reported and fixed by Graeme
  Mathieson.
* piston switch errors out early if not provided with the right arguments.
  Thanks to Graeme Mathieson for the info and patch.
* New internal command parser.  No visible external changes.

1.3.0 (2007-01-22)
* Piston status shows the revision number of locked repositories.  Thanks to
  Chris Wanstrath <http://errtheblog.com/>.
* New piston switch subcommand to switch repository locations.  Thanks to
  Greg Spurrier for the prompt which resulted in finally implementing this.

1.2.1 (2006-11-20)
* Import subcommand would fail with a "svn: Explicit target required
  ('vendor/rails' interpreted as prop value)" error.  This was a minor
  error in the import code.  Reported by Daniel N.
* The import subcommand could import another revision than what was intended,
  if HEAD was updated while the import is in progress.

1.2.0 (2006-11-17)
* New status subcommand.  Shows M if locally or remotely modified. Applies to
  one, many, all folders.  This subcommand *requires* the use of a Subversion
  1.2.0 client.  Thanks to Chris Wanstrath for the inspiration.  His Rake
  tasks are available at http://errtheblog.com/post/38.
* Minor patch by Miguel Ibero Carreras to make Subversion always use the
  C locale, instead of the current one.  This allows Piston to be used
  with internationalized versions of Subversion.  David Bittencourt later
  reported the same problem.  Thanks!
* Better handle how update finds it's latest local revision to prevent
  conflicts.  If you had never locally changed your vendor repositories,
  this fix will change nothing for you.  This helps prevent local conflicts
  if you had ever applied a local patch.
  *CAVEAT*: See the release announcement at
            http://blog.teksol.info/articles/2006/11/17/piston-1-2-0-status-better-update
            for a required local operation.

1.1.1 (2006-08-30)
* Add contrib/piston [Michael Schuerig]
* Non-recursively add the root directory of the managed folder then set Piston
  properties before adding the contents of the managed folder.  This is to
  help ease work along if an inconsistent EOL is encountered during the
  import.  The user can finish the import by svn add'ing the rest of the
  folder until all files are added.  Piston properties will already have been
  set.

1.1.0 (2006-08-26)
* New 'convert' subcommand converts existing svn:externals to Piston managed
  folders.  Thanks to Dan Kubb for the idea.
* update now recursively finds the folders to process.  It bases it's search
  on the presence or absence of the piston:root property.
* Changed lock and unlock messages to be more detailed.

1.0.1 (2006-08-24)
* Corrected minor bug where the core extensions were in core_ext/core_ext
  instead of being in core_ext.
* Require the parent working copy path be at HEAD before importing / updating.
* Don't do unnecessary merges if the file had not changed prior to the update.
* During the update, if adding a folder, do an svn mkdir instead of a cp_r.

1.0.0 (2006-08-24)
* Initial version
